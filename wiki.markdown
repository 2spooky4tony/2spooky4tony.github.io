# I want to build a cafe locator.
Here is an image of a![cafe](https://res.cloudinary.com/sagacity/image/upload/c_crop,h_1333,w_2000,x_0,y_0/c_limit,dpr_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_80,w_1080/LaurenKelly_CherryPublicHouse_6_ebjbir.jpg)

I have been interested in a cafe locator for quite some time. I can never seem to find all the cafes within my area
when using [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com). I hope to make an app more streamlined.

## Why I want to find cafes.
Sometimes when I use google maps, I can only see what is near me. Then I have to constantly zoom in and out, refreshing the search to see
more cafes appear on the map. I want to make an *app* that can locate **all cafes** without loading in other elements. 

### It would also be nice to have a **favorites** list in the app for cafes.

## My favorite cafes.
- [Cafe 1](https://goo.gl/maps/zFszX5ej2qJUn2gy5)
- [Cafe 2](https://g.page/KokuCafeMarket?shareurl)
- [Cafe/Milk Tea 3](https://g.page/tea-king-seattle?share)
